<br>when was netball invented? 
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
The history of netball can be traced to the early development of basketball. A year after basketball was invented in 1891, the sport was modified for women to accommodate social conventions regarding their participation in sport, giving rise to women's basketball. Variations of women's basketball arose across the United States and in England. At the Madame Ã–sterberg Physical Training College Dartford, England, the rules of women's basketball were modified over several years to form an entirely new sport: "net ball".[1] The sport was invented to encourage young females to be physically active and energetic. The first codified rules of netball were published at the start of the twentieth century, and from there the new sport spread throughout the British Empire.

 Netball is a relatively old sport which has grown from humble roots to become a major sport throughout the world. The history of netball dates back to the late 1890s, when it was developed in England, following the introduction of basketball a few years earlier. The sport quickly grabbed hold, with women throughout the British empire participating as a way to socialise and stay healthy.
